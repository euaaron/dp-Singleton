Design Patterns #1 - Singleton

This is the first from a whole series of academic projects were I will implement different code quality concepts in small projects.

The Singleton pattern is recommended when you need to access the same data in many parts of your application. 
So instead of instantiating it everywhere or everytime we need, we make a SINGLE instance of the object we want to access and use it.

In this example I made a very simple GitHub Service that gets repos data from my profile. Then I made some JUnit tests to check if everything is working as should.
